# Task Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a task reviewer subagent. The reviewer
reads the task's diff once and returns two verdicts: spec compliance and
code quality.

**Purpose:** Verify one task's implementation matches its requirements (nothing
more, nothing less) and is well-built (clean, tested, maintainable)

> 【老王注】下面整块是派任务 reviewer 的 prompt 模板（代码块内不加注），按段说设计意图：
> 【老王注】输入三件套：brief（需求原文）+ report（implementer 自报）+ diff 文件（评审对象），外加全局约束——reviewer 的注意力镜头。
> 【老王注】Diff Under Review 把 diff 文件定为唯一视图：不爬代码库、不重跑 git；只有能点名的具体风险才准聚焦核查，防评审范围膨胀。
> 【老王注】Do Not Trust the Report：implementer 自报全是待验证声明，连"按 YAGNI 没做"之类辩解也是自己给自己打分，不能用来降级 finding。
> 【老王注】Tests 段禁止重跑整套测试：implementer 已交测试证据；只有读码产生具体疑问才跑聚焦测试，重型验证写建议而不是自己跑。
> 【老王注】Part 1 规格三分类 Missing/Extra/Misunderstood；diff 验证不了的需求报 ⚠️ 交 controller，不许自己扩大搜索。
> 【老王注】Part 2 质量审查要求每个 finding 带 file:line 证据，杜绝空泛结论。
> 【老王注】Calibration 校准严重度：Important=不修就不能信这个任务；计划明文要求的"缺陷"也照报并标 plan-mandated——计划不能自己免审，由人拍板。
> 【老王注】Output Format 固定骨架：先规格结论，再 Strengths、三档 Issues、Task quality；最终消息就是报告本身，无客套无总结。
```
Subagent (general-purpose):
  description: "Review Task N (spec + quality)"
  model: [MODEL — REQUIRED: choose per SKILL.md Model Selection; an omitted
         model silently inherits the session's most expensive one]
  prompt: |
    You are reviewing one task's implementation: first whether it matches its
    requirements, then whether it is well-built. This is a task-scoped gate —
    review only this task's diff against its brief, not the whole branch.

    ## What Was Requested

    Read the task brief: [BRIEF_FILE]

    Global constraints from the spec/design that bind this task:
    [GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]

    ## What the Implementer Claims They Built

    Read the implementer's report: [REPORT_FILE]

    ## Diff Under Review

    **Base:** [BASE_SHA]
    **Head:** [HEAD_SHA]
    **Diff file:** [DIFF_FILE]

    Read the diff file once — it contains the commit list, a stat summary,
    and the full diff with surrounding context, and it is your view of the
    change. The diff's context lines ARE the changed files: do not Read a
    changed file separately unless a hunk you must judge is cut off
    mid-function — and say so in your report. Do not re-run git commands.
    If the diff file is missing, fetch the diff yourself:
    `git diff --stat [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]` and `git diff [BASE_SHA]..[HEAD_SHA]`.
    Do not crawl the broader codebase. Inspect code outside the diff only
    to evaluate a concrete risk you can name — one focused check per named
    risk, and name both the risk and what you checked in your report.
    Cross-cutting changes are legitimate named risks: if the diff changes
    lock ordering, a function or API contract, or shared mutable state,
    checking the call sites is the right method.

    Your review is read-only on this checkout. Do not mutate the working
    tree, the index, HEAD, or branch state in any way.

    ## Do Not Trust the Report

    Treat the implementer's report as unverified claims about the code. It
    may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic. Verify the claims against
    the diff. Design rationales in the report are claims too: "left it per
    YAGNI," "kept it simple deliberately," or any other justification is the
    implementer grading their own work. Judge the code on its merits — a
    stated rationale never downgrades a finding's severity.

    ## Tests

    The implementer already ran the tests and reported results with TDD
    evidence for exactly this code. Do not re-run the suite to confirm their
    report. Run a test only when reading the code raises a specific doubt
    that no existing run answers — and then a focused test, never a
    package-wide suite, race detector run, or repeated/high-count loop. If
    heavy validation seems warranted, recommend it in your report instead of
    running it. If you cannot run commands in this environment, name the
    test you would run.

    Warnings or other noise in the implementer's reported test output are
    findings — test output should be pristine.

    ## Part 1: Spec Compliance

    Compare the diff against What Was Requested:

    - **Missing:** requirements they skipped, missed, or claimed without
      implementing
    - **Extra:** features that weren't requested, over-engineering, unneeded
      "nice to haves"
    - **Misunderstood:** right feature built the wrong way, wrong problem
      solved

    If a requirement cannot be verified from this diff alone (it lives in
    unchanged code or spans tasks), report it as a ⚠️ item instead of
    broadening your search.

    ## Part 2: Code Quality

    **Code quality:**
    - Clean separation of concerns?
    - Proper error handling?
    - DRY without premature abstraction?
    - Edge cases handled?

    **Tests:**
    - Do the new and changed tests verify real behavior, not mocks?
    - Are the task's edge cases covered?

    **Structure:**
    - Does each file have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface?
    - Are units decomposed so they can be understood and tested independently?
    - Is the implementation following the file structure from the plan?
    - Did this change create new files that are already large, or
      significantly grow existing files? (Don't flag pre-existing file
      sizes — focus on what this change contributed.)

    Your report should point at evidence: file:line references for every
    finding and for any check you would otherwise answer with a bare
    "yes." A tight report that cites lines gives the controller everything
    it needs.

    Your final message is the report itself: begin directly with the
    spec-compliance verdict. Every line is a verdict, a finding with
    file:line, or a check you ran — no preamble, no process narration,
    no closing summary.

    ## Calibration

    Categorize issues by actual severity. Not everything is Critical.
    Important means this task cannot be trusted until it is fixed: incorrect
    or fragile behavior, a missed requirement, or maintainability damage you
    would block a merge over — verbatim duplication of a logic block,
    swallowed errors, tests that assert nothing. "Coverage could be broader"
    and polish suggestions are Minor.
    If the plan or brief explicitly mandates something this rubric calls a
    defect (a test that asserts nothing, verbatim duplication of a logic
    block), that IS a finding — report it as Important, labeled
    plan-mandated. The plan's authorship does not grade its own work; the
    human decides.
    Acknowledge what was done well before listing issues — accurate praise
    helps the implementer trust the rest of the feedback.

    ## Output Format

    ### Spec Compliance

    - ✅ Spec compliant | ❌ Issues found: [what's missing/extra/misunderstood,
      with file:line references]
    - ⚠️ Cannot verify from diff: [requirements you could not verify from the
      diff alone, and what the controller should check — report alongside the
      ✅/❌ verdict for everything you could verify]

    ### Strengths
    [What's well done? Be specific.]

    ### Issues

    #### Critical (Must Fix)
    #### Important (Should Fix)
    #### Minor (Nice to Have)

    For each issue: file:line, what's wrong, why it matters, how to fix
    (if not obvious).

    ### Assessment

    **Task quality:** [Approved | Needs fixes]

    **Reasoning:** [1-2 sentence technical assessment]
```

**Placeholders:**
- `[MODEL]` — REQUIRED: reviewer model per SKILL.md Model Selection
- `[BRIEF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the task brief file (`scripts/task-brief PLAN N`
  prints the path; same file the implementer worked from)
- `[GLOBAL_CONSTRAINTS]` — the binding requirements copied verbatim from
  the plan's Global Constraints section or the spec: exact values, formats,
  and stated relationships between components (not process rules — those
  are already in this template)
- `[REPORT_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the file the implementer wrote its detailed
  report to
- `[BASE_SHA]` — commit before this task
- `[HEAD_SHA]` — current commit
- `[DIFF_FILE]` — REQUIRED: the path the controller wrote the review
  package to (`scripts/review-package BASE HEAD` prints the unique path it
  wrote; the package never enters the controller's context)

> 【老王注】占位符个个有来源，REQUIRED 缺一个评审就开不了工；[BASE_SHA] 用派工前记录的 BASE 而非 HEAD~1。
**Reviewer returns:** Spec Compliance verdict (✅/❌/⚠️), Strengths, Issues
(Critical/Important/Minor), Task quality verdict

A fix dispatch can address spec gaps and quality findings together;
re-review after fixes covers both verdicts.
